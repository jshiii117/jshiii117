# 👋 Hi there, I'm James - a passionate CS + Business student! 💻

I'm currently studying Computer Science and I'm absolutely thrilled about exploring new technologies and diving deep into coding. As a primarily self-taught developer, I've enjoyed taking a practical and project-focused approach to learning.
